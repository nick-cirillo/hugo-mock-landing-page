# User Stories for Character Arc

Character Arc lets you create endless character dialogue that tells a real story. The Character Arc API lets you integrate our dialogue generation into any game development environment, hassle-free.

## Core Features

1. As a game designer, I want to create games that have infinitely branching narratives and procedural characters, all with genuinely emotional character arcs.
2. As a game writer, I want to focus on the emotional journey of characters rather than writing repetitive dialogue for when players interact with a character over and over.
3. As a writer, I want dialogue to adapt based on character backstory and pre-defined lore elements.
4. As a game producer, I want to lower the costs of creating gigantic games with potentially thousands of pages of dialogue.
5. As a player, I want my conversations and choices to shape character interactions over time.

## Other features

1. As a developer, I want an easy-to-use API that seamlessly integrates with common game engines like Unity and Unreal.
2. As a writer, I want dialogue to maintain character consistency and emotional depth across multiple interactions.
3. As a localization manager, I want dialogue to support multiple languages while maintaining tone and nuance.
4. As a QA tester, I want tools to track and debug dialogue generation to identify potential inconsistencies.

## Potential feature expansion

1. As a writer, I want dialogue to include different speech patterns and dialects for unique character voices.
2. As a creative director, I want character dialogue to be voiced dynamically and realistically.
3. As a localization specialist, I want AI-driven translation tools that adapt character speech to different cultural contexts.
4. As a developer, I want dialogue to recognize and interact with real-time player microphone input.
